# ACM FRONTEND
This is my frontend part of the induction management app i tried to build . It has functionalities to manage interviews and send reminders (emails).Hopefully will add more in the future.

I used react js as my frontend techstack and express for backend with MongoDB for database management.


# ROADMAP
-set up the basic react file skeleton with all the components . 
-I initially decided I would go for individual css for each component but it turned out to be confusing so wrapped it all up .
-setup components for applicants/interviewees , admins/interviewers and interviewers and email functionality with a basic dashboard .
-i'm not that great at design so the ui is pretty simple with the bg from triangify
