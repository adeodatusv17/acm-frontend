# ACM FRONTEND

This is the frontend part of the Induction Management App that I am building. It currently supports functionalities like managing interviews, sending reminders (emails), and tracking progress. I plan to add more features in the future to enhance its capabilities.

I used **React.js** for the frontend, **Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for database management. The app is a work in progress, and Iâ€™m continually working on improving both the functionality and design.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Provides an overview of applicants, interviews, and admins.
- **Applicants Management**: Allows adding, updating, deleting, and searching for applicants.
- **Admin/Interviewer Management**: Handles interviewers (admins) with options to manage and update their details.
- **Interview Scheduling**: Create, update, and manage interviews, with a toggle for interview status.
- **Email Reminders**: Integrated functionality to send email reminders to applicants or interviewers.
  
## Roadmap

- Set up the basic React file skeleton with all the components.
- Initially decided to use individual CSS for each component, but found it confusing, so switched to a global stylesheet.
- Built components for:
  - **Applicants/Interviewees**
  - **Admins/Interviewers**
  - **Interviews**
  - **Email functionality**
- Designed a simple UI with a background from **Trianglify** since design is not my primary focus.
- Integrated a dashboard that provides a clear overview of key stats.
  
### Future Plans

- Improve the design with a more polished and responsive UI.
- Add more complex user roles and permissions.
- Implement robust validation for form inputs.
- Expand email functionality to include automated reminders.
- Enhance the dashboard with additional charts and performance metrics.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with global styles
- **Email Service**: Node.js email module for sending reminders
- **Deployment**: [Add details about deployment if applicable]
